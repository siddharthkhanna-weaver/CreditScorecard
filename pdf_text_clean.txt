Why is your Credit Health Important?
Each time you apply for a credit product (any kind of loan or a credit card), the lender bank or nancial institution rst checks your
creditworthiness - By looking at your Credit Score. Through your Credit Score, lenders try to gauge whether you would repay the loan EMIs or
credit card dues responsibly if they approve your application for loan or credit card.
Your Credit Score ranges between 300 and 900 (the higher the better) and is based on your track-record with credit. This score is determined
by how well you have behaved with credit in the past i.e. if you have paid your EMIs and credit card bills on time, how much debt you have
taken, what is your existing debt, are you too reliant on credit, how long have you been using credit etc.
A high credit score means you are credit healthy and banks and other lenders should be happy to provide you with a loan or credit card. A high
credit score will also help you get credit at the lowest interest rates. A low score, on the other hand, poses a risk for lenders and hence, you
would struggle to get a credit product from them.
How is your Credit Score calculated?
Every month, all lending institutions in India submit repayment performance of their borrowers to credit bureaus, which calculate the credit
score of each borrower. In India, there are 4 credit bureaus, each has its credit scoring model. Hence, your credit score, though between 300 and
900, would vary from one bureau to another.
However, all bureaus largely consider ve factors while calculating your credit score  Payment History, Credit Utilization Ratio, Age of Credit
History, Total Number of Credit Accounts and Number of Credit Enquiries carried out in the past.
Whats in this Credit Health Report?
Paisabazaar.coms Credit Health report dives into your credit behaviour and provides you with a succinct performance analysis on each of the
factors that determine your credit score. Its jargon-free, easy to understand and would tell you where you are doing well and areas where you
need to improve.
Building your credit score and staying credit healthy is a continuous process, as your score can change each month and there are multiple
factors at play that can have a long-lasting inuence on your score. In this report, we would also provide you with specic and relevant
guidelines and recommendations that will help you live a credit healthy life.
Remember, staying credit healthy at all times is critical, even when you do not need credit. This is because most of us eventually need to rely on
credit to full life goals like buying a house or car or for our childrens higher education. Also, credit often becomes a necessity during
unforeseen circumstances like a medical emergency or a sudden travel need. And since your credit score can be built only over time, we need
to stay on top of our credit health, always.

What does Credit Mix mean?
Credit instruments are broadly classied into 2 categories  secured credit and unsecured credit.
Secured credit such as home loan, auto loan and secured credit cards are backed by collateral such as property, car and xed deposit
respectively. Unsecured credit such as personal loan, education loan and a credit card is not backed by any collateral.
A healthy credit mix usually consists of both secured and unsecured loans. If you have a mortgage, an auto loan, and credit cards, that's
generally regarded as a nice mix of credit that will help keep your score in good shape.

You have 0 missed payments in the past 3 years: Well done! You havent missed any EMI or credit card payments over the past 3 years which
shows you are a responsible borrower. Keep making timely repayments as it helps you build your credit score.

for you to avail new credit in the future. Additionally making timely payments also helps you save on late fees.
Ideally you should never miss a loan EMI/credit card bill payment. Also, please note that missed payments are reected on your credit report
for a long time and can adversely impact your eligibility for new loans/credit cards.

Credit Card Utilisation 	4 % Credit Limit Used
Your Credit Utilization Ratio is 4%. You have maintained a credit utilisation ratio within the 30% limit. This is ideal and positively impacts your
credit score.
What does Credit Card Utilization Ratio mean?
Banks set limits on credit cards based on your credit prole, history, income, employment type, etc. Credit utilization ratio indicates the
proportion of credit you have used against the total credit available to you. A high credit utilization ratio (i.e. over 30%) indicates heavy
dependence on credit. This is considered risky by lenders and may impact your credit score and your eligibility for new loans and credit cards.
We recommend that you maintain your credit utilization ratio at 30% or lower to ensure a positive impact on your credit score. This can be
achieved by paying all your credit card dues and in case you frequently spend more than 30% of your credit limit, you may try increasing your
credit limit. You can raise your credit limit by requesting your existing credit card issuer, or applying for a new credit card if you have a good or
excellent credit score.

Key Points
You have used your credit card carefully which indicates that you do
not have an excessive reliance on debt increases. This has a positive
impact on your credit health.
A clean credit history with no missed payments makes you eligible for
the best loans and credit card oers
Paisabazaars Recommendations
Increasing the credit limit on your credit card(s) without increasing your
debt burden can help you reduce your credit utilization ratio.
Check with your Lender to opt for increased Credit Limit on your active
cards to ensure usage on your card is less than 30% of the sanctioned
limit.
Use Paisabazaar's platform to compare and apply for a higher segment
card to avail higher credit limit.
Dont close your unused Credit Cards unless they have an annual fee to
maintain overall credit limit.
Use Credit Card Regularly and make On-Time, complete payments on
Credit Card bills.
Avoid making minimum due repayments as it leads to building upon
outstanding and interest calculations from date of purchase.
Repay entire outstanding to avoid high nance charges levied on
unpaid credit card outstanding.

Age of Credit History 	12 yrs+ Age of oldest account
Your Oldest Credit Account is 12 years old: You have been using credit instruments for some time. Your credit score will be impacted
positively as long as you have maintained a track record of using credit instruments judiciously during this period.
What does Age of Credit History mean?
Length of credit history shows how long you have been using credit instruments such as loans and credit cards. This is calculated based on the
date on which you opened your rst credit card or loan account.
A long credit history (5 years or more) with responsible behaviour shows a good track record. This gives lenders more condence in approving
your loan and credit card applications. When lenders check your credit report as part of evaluating a credit card or loan application, having a
long credit history with a clean repayment record can help you get the best oers.
To maintain a long credit history, you should keep old credit cards active instead of closing them and opening new accounts. Please note that if
you have an add-on credit card with your parent/spouse as the primary holder, it will not contribute to the length of your credit history.

Key Points
You have a long credit history. It can be an asset as long as you have
behaved responsibly with your repayments in the past and have a
strong track record.
Paisabazaars Recommendations
Keeping your old credit card(s) active can help you increase the length
of your credit history and improve your chances of securing new credit.
Continue maintaining your accounts active by making timely payments
on your secured and/or unsecured loans and/or credit cards.

Credit Enquiries 	0 Total Hard Enquiries
Your credit report and score were accessed 0 time by prospective lenders in the past 12 months.
What do Credit Enquiries mean?
A hard enquiry is generated whenever your credit report is accessed by prospective lenders. This is done when you apply for a new loan or
credit card. The records of such enquiries in your credit report include the name of lender accessing your credit report, the purpose of
accessing, the date on which report was accessed, etc.
If multiple hard enquiries show up on your credit report within a short time, you will be perceived as credit hungry and this can adversely
impact your credit score. Additionally, lenders may perceive you as a risky prospect.
Key Points
You have very few hard enquiries on your credit prole in the last 12
months which is a good credit behaviour.
If you access your credit report through Paisabazaar or the credit
bureaus directly, it is considered as a soft enquiry. Soft enquiries have
no impact on your credit score no matter how many times you access
your credit report.
Paisabazaars Recommendations
Use Paisabazaars loan/credit card comparison platform instead to
check for best and most-suited credit card/loan oers for you, without
impacting your credit score.
